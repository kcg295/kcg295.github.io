## Teaching

Teaching is one of my passions. During my time at New York University Tandon
School of Engineering I have taught 7 sections of classes, amounting to over
500 students. 

#### Approach

Students learn best when they are comfortable and engaged. For this reason I
use a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)
approach whenever possible. However, in recent semesters I have been unable to
work in a flipped classroom setting due to the amount of students in my online
classes. For these semesters I have focused on creating captivating lecture
content and still encouraging interaction when feasable.

##### Online Teaching

During the pandemic I have learned how to use technology efficiently to create
as close to an in-person experience as I can. I have built my own home studio
complete with semi-professional lighting, a green screen, a camera, and a
professional grade microphone to deliver high quality video to my students.

##### Assignments and Labs

I believe that people learn best by doing. That's why I take an assignment 
focused approach in my classes. Both classes I teach include programming
assignments focused around security, and one of my classes includes many labs
that teach students how to use some security technologies and perform attacks
and defenses hands-on. To see the assignments I have developed, please view the
[assignments](/assignments) page.

#### Classes

During my time at New York University Tandon School of Engineering I have taught
two courses: Information Security and Privacy and Application Security.

##### Information Security and Privacy

The Information Security and Privacy (ISP) course at NYU Tandon is an
introduction to the basic concepts, definitions, and technologies in the areas
of Information Security and Privacy. This include foundations such as access
control, basic information about cryptographic primatives (hashing, asymmetric
and symmetric cryptography, etc.) security design principles, threat modeling,
privacy, and more. For more information, please see the 
[syllabus](/assets/syllabi/ISP.pdf).

##### Application Security

The Application Security course at NYU Tandon teaches about the vulnerabilities
typically found in modern applications and focuses on the technologies and
techniques used to defend them. This course is programming focused, and includes
four assignments in which students must fix broken and poorly written code to
patch vulnerabilities. Through these assignments and the course lectures
students learn how to write safe and secure code, how to use tools such as
fuzzers, CI/CD systems, cloud deployment systems, web development frameworks,
database encryption tools, and more to secure applications they write in the
future. For more information, please see the 
[syllabus](/assets/syllabi/ApplicationSecurity.pdf).
