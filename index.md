## Welcome to my page

My name is Kevin Gallagher and I am a Postdoctoral Associate at 
[New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu),
a founder of [PrivacyLX](https://privacylx.org), a Tor Core Contributor, and an
activist. I teach the Information Security and Privacy course and Application
Security course for the
